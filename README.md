# hs-code-generator
This repository contains sample code for usage of the HS-code generator by CODICI, https://www.codi.ci/

The sample codes in different languages are there to get you started and by no means complete code.

Please note that you need to fill in your own bearer token in the examples where it says **your-bearer-token**. The examples all use the test API gateway:
https://test-api.codi.ci/api/search instead of the production one. The test API will accept any bearer token or even no bearer token but will tell you so in the resulting message.
The production API is located at https://api.codi.ci/api/search

Full explanation of the API, testing and it's usage can be found on https://codi.ci/api-uk.php
